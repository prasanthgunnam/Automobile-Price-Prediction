# Automobile-Price-Prediction
This was the project I worked on for my summer internship at IEEE, Mumbai. It was a virtual internship where I have learned about data analysis and machine learning concepts.
It was a great experience I had which made me more enthusiastic towards Data Science and Machine Learning.
This project is about automobile price prediction using a Machine Learning. The algorithm used in this project is Linear Regression.
